OP-TEE Device Tree Bindings

OP-TEE is a piece of software using hardware features to provide a Trusted
Execution Environment. The security can be provided with ARM TrustZone, but
also by virtualization or a separate chip. As there's no single OP-TEE
vendor we're using "optee" as the first part of compatible property,
indicating the OP-TEE protocol is used when communicating with the secure
world.

* OP-TEE based on ARM TrustZone required properties:

- compatible     : should contain "optee,optee-tz"

- method         : The method of calling the OP-TEE Trusted OS. Permitted
                   values are:

                   "smc" : SMC #0, with the register assignments specified
		           in drivers/tee/optee/optee_smc.h

                   "hvc" : HVC #0, with the register assignments specified
		           in drivers/tee/optee/optee_smc.h



Example:
	optee {
		compatible = "optee,optee-tz";
		method = "smc";
	};
